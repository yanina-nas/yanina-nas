### Hi! I'm Nastya.

- ðŸ«€ Iâ€™m a self-taught software engineer based in sunny Brussels, Belgium. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently looking for a full-time junior position.

- ðŸ¦¾ I'm a career switcher: in my previous life I was a professional rower with academical background in medicine.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development and machine learning, whilst sharpening my competitive programming skills.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm approaching open source waters beyond minimal contributions and looking to collaborate on C#, JavaScript, and python projects. 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding bugs in my CV.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about a sophisticated algorithm you'd normally expect from someone with a CS degree. 

- ðŸ“« I have a medical degree without any expeience, but I turned professional rower during university years.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/them/their are all fine. I don't mind, really.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I spent 7 years boat racing  a European Champ title and lots of hilarious stories up my sleeve.
